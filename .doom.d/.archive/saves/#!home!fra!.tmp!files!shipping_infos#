PLEASE READ: If you cannot make sure the item arrives without custom charges please follow the instructions below:
- DO NOT label it as gift
- label it is as normal goods
- provide a LONG and DETAILED description about the item type but NOT the model
- declare a lower value scaling the digits until the value is below 20€ but above 10€, cost to declare below:
  14,57€ (since the item costs 40,57€ please declare 14,57€)
- Insert a RECEIPT of the payment WITH the lower value (14,57€) INSIDE the package AND OUTSIDE the package (attached with the rest of the labels, etc.) (Remember the correct lower value! 14,57€)  
If you cannot follow these instructions it is ok so PLEASE cancel and refund the order.
If the item arrives WITH custom charges WITHOUT having followed the instructions I WILL OPEN an aliexpress dispute!
