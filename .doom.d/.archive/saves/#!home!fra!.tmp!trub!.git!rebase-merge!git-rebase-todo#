# Rebase 834f507..834f507 onto 834f507 (1 command)
#
# Commands:
# p        pick = use commit
# r        reword = use commit, but edit the commit message
# e        edit = use commit, but stop for amending
# s        squash = use commit, but meld into previous commit
# f        fixup = like "squash", but discard this commit's log message
# x        exec = run command (the rest of the line) using shell
# d        drop = remove commit
# u        undo last change
# , c      tell Git to make it happen
# , k      tell Git that you changed your mind, i.e. abort
# k        move point to previous line
# j        move point to next line
# M-k      move the commit at point up
# M-j      move the commit at point down
# RET      show the commit at point in another buffer
#
# These lines can be re-ordered; they are executed from top to bottom.
#
# If you remove a line here THAT COMMIT WILL BE LOST.
#
# However, if you remove everything, the rebase will be aborted.
#
# Note that empty commits are commented out
