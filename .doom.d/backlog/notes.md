_Results_
-	3	Liquid	medium	jar
-	2	Dense	medium	jar
-	1/3	Caramelized	small	jar

_Considerations_
-	Boiling	without	spinning	too	much?	To	do	something	else	while	boiling
-	Less	Sugar	depending	on	cherries	sweetness/maturation
-	More	Cloves?

## SYRUPED	Cherries

_Results_
-	3	big	jar
-	1	medium	jar
-	1	glass	3-4	cherries

_Considerations_
-	Always	start	with	sterilization	when	boiling	the	jars,	consider	boiling	even	hours	before,	cooling	takes
time
-	Remove	stems	while	boiling	the	syrup,	it	is	quick,	if	jars	are	already	sterilized	than	the	canning	process
can	be	done	in	60m(?)

## Prunes	JAM

_Data_
-	3Kg	prunes
-	750g	sugar

-	Resting	Time	(24H)
-	Boiling	Time	(3H)


_Results
-	1	liquid	medium	jar
-	2	big	jar
-	1/3	medium	jar_

_Considerations
-	Cut	the	florets	into	smaller	pieces,	for	easier	stirring	during	boiling	and	for	a	more	balanced	compound
-	Calculate	wate	50ml	per	Kg,	add	more	if	trouble	stirring	when	adding	sugar	before	resting
-	florets	seeds	are	no	problem	they	blend	in	the	jam
-	color	is	a	very	pale	yellow	tending	to	brown
-	the	pot	should	loose	quite	an	high	amount	before	getting	dense,	more	sugar	less	water	should	be	easier	ofc
-	vincotto	smell	is	predominant_

## SYRUPED	Apricots	and	Florets

-	Oil	and	garlic	at	the	base	for	a	few	moments	with	low	heat	in	the	pot
-	Put	the	pieces	in	the	pot,	start	squashing	and	steering	until	everything	is	imbued	in	liquid,	add	spices,	drain,	taste	and	add
spices.
-	Spices	order:	minced	chili,	pepper,	salt,	curry	x1	veil	each.	~30min	after	boiling	add	more	spices,	e.g.	pepper,curry,salt	1x

-	100g	grapes-	100g	figs-	1	egg
-	2	slices	of	butter	(30g)-	1	tbsp	of	oil	(15g)-	Mix	everything	and
_Results_ -	4	rows	of	cooked	fruits	mixes _Considerations_
-	Try	only	with	yogurt?-	Try	mixing	flour-	Place	it	in	a	tin	for	making	cookies	or	in	a	sauce	pan	to	make	a	casserole

## Apples/Grapes	JAM Data -	~1Kg	apples

-	~1Kg	grapes	(DEJUICED)-	3	1/2inch	dried	ginger	roots	(15g)-	2	tbsp	sugar	cane	(30g)
-	3	tbsp	honey	(45g)-	1	bag	camomile _Results_
-	1	VERY	LARGE	jar	(1KG)-	2	Medium	jar-	1/2	Long	jar
_Considerations_ -	1	Bag	of	camomile	seems	enough	to	give	flavor-	As	always	add	enough	water	to	fill	the	pot,	and	slow	boil	it	all	(As	apples	can't	afford	much	liquid	since	are	very	low	on
sugar)-	Should	pass	apples	to	the	blender	far	longer	(even	10	minutes?)

## Grapes/Figs	JAM Data -	5Kg	grapes	(nearly	acidic)

-	0.5Kg	figs	(nearly	acidic) _Results_ -	4	Medium	jar
-	1/2	Small	jar _Considerations_ -	grapes	loose	a	lot	of	weight

-	4	hazelnuts,	2	walnuts,	4	almonds	(topping) _Results_ -	1	ceramic	tin
_Considerations_ -	Reduce	amount	of	oil,	by	(try	10g	less)-	maybe	add	more	nuts,	crush	them,	very	important	to	keep	on	top	of	the	purea	topping	so	that	they	get	roasted
-	slightly	reduce	amount	of	flour	for	the	dough-	try	adding	more	fruit/jam	to	the	dough

## Potatoes	pizza

_Data_ -	300g	potatoes-	100g	flour
-	50g	rice-	origan/oil/salt	for	topping-	yogurt	just	enough
_Results_ -	1	ceramic	rectangular	tin _Considerations_

-	Crust	on	top	gets	verything	(	~0.5cm	)	maybe	cooking	spreading	at	this	height	to	make	some	potatoe
cookies
-	remember	to	oil	the	tin,	otherwise	low	flour	content	sticks
-	rice	is	good	in	the	dough
-	put	condiments	within	a	base	layer	and	top	layer	for	proper	potato	pizza

## Pizza/1 Data -	175g	flour

-	1	thin	pizza _Considerations_ -	Potatoes	ftw
-	good	crunchiness-	try	double	baking,	5/10	minutes	then	add	condiments,	bake	again-	Make	sure	plate	fit	the	batter	to	avoid	uneven	baking

## Fruits	purea/1 Data-	4	Pears	(slices)

_-	10	Apples	(slices)-	4	Quinces	(slices)-	1	tbsp	honey
-	2	tbsp	sugar-	250g	yogurt-	lemon	juice
Results-	1	2/3	bowl
Considerations_
-	yogurt	is	not	worth	it	unless	half	the	mixture
-	can	last	more	than	a	week	in	fridge	(the	lemon	juiced	version)

## Quinces	purea/

## Biscuits/1 Data -	280g	flour

-	80g	yogurt-	100g	persimmon	purea-	pinch	salt/bs
_Results_ -	40	too	small	cookies _Considerations_

- -	150g	flour	"semo"-	150g	flour	"1"	80g	potato
-	50g	oil-	yogurt	50g-	quinces	purea	4	tbsp
_Results_ -	20	medium	size	cookies _Considerations_
-	too	moisty-	not	enough	fats	needs	at	least	1/
-	needs	higher	oven	temps	and	longer	cooking	times-	don't	use	additional	yogurt	if	already	using	mother	yeast?-	COOK	THOROUGLY,	BETTER	A	HARD	DRIED	COOKIE	THAN	MOLD
-	Form	and	size	of	cookies	is	important	for	even	baking **Biscuits/**
_Data_ -	100g	mother	yeast

-	100g	honey-	128g	oil-	clementine	peel
-	salt _Results-	60	5cm	biscuits,	slightly	soft
Considerations_


-	Require	more	leavening	try	double	day	leavening
-	oil	could	be	reduced
-	sugar	should	not	be	mixed	into	oil	because	it	is	not	soluble	in	it,	use	some	other	liquid	or	egg **Biscuits/**
_Data_ -	800g	persimmon	purea-	800g	flour
-	100g	mother	yeast-	100g	almonds-	100g	walnuts
-	salt-	1	egg _Results_
-	4	trays	3/4	filled _Considerations_ -	too	sticky,	form	shapes	with	wet	waters,	or	freeze	the	dough	into	a	cilinder	and	then	cut	pieces
-	don't	roast	nuts	too	much	10minuts	@	180C	is	enough-	use	less	flour,	think	about	how	much	persimmon	water	is	lost	during	cooking,	so	try	a	75/25	split	fruit/flour

## Eggplants/Peppers	marinade Data -	800g	eggplants

-	200g	peppers-	100g	potatoes-	1	cheese	slice
-	33cl	tomato	sauce-	1	chili-	curry/spices/garlic	q.b.
-	a	small	slice	of	some	meat _Results_ -	1	very	full	pot
_Considerations_ -	Careful	with	cheese,	do	not	let	it	attach	to	the	bottom-	spices	are	good
-	make	sure	to	remove	all	the	seeds	from	peppers-	apparently	peppers	cooked	this	way	might	not	need	to	be	peeled

-	100g	type	1	flour-	50g	mother	yeast	-	1	onion	small
-	2	small	chili-	oil	to	saute	and	a	few	drop	in	the	dough _Results_
-	400g	taralli,	2	full	tins _Considerations_
-	Mix	in	some	fresh	yeast	to	aid	leavening
-	Onions	must	be	chopped	very	fine	and	should	be	fully	caramelized	(not	yellow,	full	brown)
-	wine	(alcohol)	disrupts	leavening	more	than	expected
-	oil	can	be	reduced,	however	boiling	should	not	be	skipped	

## Sweet	Bread/1 Data -	300g	bread

-	2	eggs-	4	dried	figs-	~10	dried	cherries
-	50g	sugar-	50g/2tsp	honey-	50g	almonds
-	50g	olive	oil _Results_ -	dosage	for	2cm	tall	cake
-	crisp	on	the	outside _Considerations_
-	don't	add	too	much	tea	flavor
-	less	olive	oil
-	more	almonds,	more	finely	chopped	but	not	pasted

## Pizza/2 Data -	400g

-	artichokes/mushrooms	toppings-	ham/onions	toppings _Results_
-	3-4	cm	tall	2	tins-	slightly	undercooked	under	the	toppings _Considerations_

-	baking	like	this:	10	minutes	with	just	tomato	juice,	then	add	toppings	making	sure	leafy	ones	are	covered
by	(some	more	tomato	juice	and...)	greasy	ones	(ham,	fish,	dairies)
-	artichokes	shouldn't	be	cut	more	then	in	halves,	otherwise	loose	flavor	and	burn	out
-	mushrooms	instead	require	to	stay	above	to	dry	out	and	saute _~~~	template	~~~_

# Pickup	Games	Fast

...or	PUF.
An	endevour	to	create	a	list	of	bullet	points	to	learn	to	play	a	game,	or	learn	to	watch	a	game.

To	play	the	game
bullet	points	should	be	focused	around	the	game	flow,	how	to	achieve	Y	by	doing	x.	The	flow	is	the	most
important	thing	to	understand	about	a	game,	mechanics	and	knowledge	revolve	around	it,	it	can	be
described	as	the	pace	toward	the	endgoal	grouping	the	most	common	sequences	of	inputs.

To	watch	the	game
such	bullets	points	should	focus	on	particular	aspects	of	the	game,	some	are	more	genre	oriented,	some
are	game	oriented.
Example,	to	appreciate	dota	what	is	important	is	not	to	watch	the	team	fight,	but	the	position	of	players
before	the	team	fight.	Such	information	can	really	be	appreciated	and	makes	you	love	a	team	more	than
another,	because	depicts	the	preparation.	In	dota	in	particular	in	fact	the	unfolding	of	the	team	fight	is
usually	decided	by	the	position	of	each	player	before	it,	and	that	is	something	to	really	appreciate.
In	counter	strike	the	coordination	and	the	execution	of	setups	is	what	can	be	appreciated,	much	more	then
frags	that	tend	to	be	repetitive	in	their	execution	and	expected	at	a	certain	level	of	skill.	1vX	scenarios	can
also	be	really	admirable	because	they	breakout	from	team	strategies	where	2+vX	tend	to	just	be	a	subset
of	those,	and	let	the	player	show	off	their	skill,	and	level	of	quick	thinking,	also	such	scenarios	tend	to	be
the	most	original	in	term	of	positions	on	the	map.


# thought	on	spectator	in	games

the	spectator	ui	should	have	a	50%	of	game	always	visible
the	hon	spectator	ui	is	very	good,	probably	the	best	for	mobas
hearthstone	is	very	good	also	although	it	is	simpler	for	card	games	and	for	hearthstone	in	general	because
it	has	only	secrets	as	out	of	game	flow	events.	It	could	have	a	"bench"	where	something	like	legendary
minions	played	and	dropped	in	the	game	appear.
The	concept	of	lingering	informations...information	that	is	only	really	important	for	a	few	moments	but	that
is	useful	for	players	wanting	to	learn	a	game	by	spoon	feeding	notations	by	picking	just	a	few	bits	in	each
game	by	keeping	such	information	floating	around	longer.	An	example	is	cards	descriptions	in	a	card	game,
or	damage	dealt	by	a	skill	in	a	moba	game.	Very	good	for	spectating	tournament,	but	probably	best	for
helping	streamers	expand	their	viewership	but	making	less	common	games	more	accessible	and
understandable.

# AMD	Performance

I	have	done	some	dirty	tests	on	planetside	2	which	spent	months	on	a	big	patch	for	cpu	optimization	and
warframe	which	was	mentioned	before	and	has	multi	threading	as	an	option	in	the	launcher.

They	both	really	behave	in	the	same	way,	affinity	with	1	module	gives	85/90%	framerate,	with	both	cores
staying	around	80%	with	90%	peaks,	and	you	can	enable	a	third	core	from	a	second	module	to	top
performance,	after	that	you	are	just	spreading	the	computation	around	the	other	cores	without	any
framerate	improvement.

Not	even	half	of	the	chip	gets	used	in	these	optimized	games,	planetside2	is	considered	next-gen	from	a
technical	pov.

# Razer	is	good?

[quote	name="Bruticis"	url="/t/1337761/official-creative-sound-blaster-z-zx-zxr-series-
club/2640#post_22708170"]
I'd	like	to	know	this	too,	I'm	looking	for	the	exact	same	setup	as	you.	I	looked	into	the	Razer	but	I	can't
stand	their	build	quality.	I	read	a	LOT	of	forum	posts	about	the	Tiamat	suffering	the	same	build	quality
issues	and	breaking	after	a	very	short	period.[/quote]

I	give	you	my	impressions.	I	have	2	mouses	lachesis	4k	dpi,	1	had	a	problem	from	the	moment	I	bought	it	to
the	moment	is	broke,	the	other	is	still	working	fine	after	many	years.	I	also	have	had	razer	barracuda	hp-1
headphones	combod	with	ac-1	razer	soundcard,	it	was	imho	the	best	combo	I	have	ever	had,	sadly	the
headphones	broke	1	speaker	and	then	crumbled	(I	think	they	can	be	repaired	just	my	substituting	one
speaker	and	the	attaching	the	whole	skeleton	back	together),	the	ac-1	soundcard	is	still	kicking	asses	but	I
have	to	leave	it	on	my	old	pc	because	crosshair	v	z	mobo	does	not	have	pci,	only	pci	express,	I	also	have
razer	lycosa	still	working	fine	but	buttons	starts	blanking	away,	alt	and	ctrl	are	only	bluebacklight	now,
but	still	works	fine.

So	on	5	razer	products	3	upon	5	are	working	good.	It	is	more	of	a	problem	of	production	process	with	razer,
devices	produced	on	the	later	part	of	their	life	cycle	are	gonna	be	more	solid	and	with	less	or	no	problems
compared	to	the	ones	usually	bought	by	"enthusiasts"	,	razer	definitely	rushes	out	their	products	:P

I	also	have	a	pair	or	roccat	kave	5.1,	that	I	have	used	for	like	2	or	3	years,	one	day	my	brain	just	said	"no,
you're	never	gonna	torture	me	again	with	those	headphones,	or	Im	gonna	kill	u".

Now	I	have	a	pair	of	superlux	hd681	evo	which	are	lighter	and	modmic4,	im	not	gonna	say	they	are	great	or
better	or	w/e,	I'll	just	say	I	can	hear	and	discern	more	stuff	than	what	I	did	with	kave.	The	mic	im	not	so
happy	about	,	I	wonder	what	would	it	be	like	with	the	emishield.

Anyway,	5.1/7.1	headphones

# Untitled

Consider	the	ideas,	not	much	the	numbers,	you	might	have	a	better	understanding	of	dota	numbers	so	you
might	tweak	them	accordingly.

Greater	bash:
-	Speed	duration	before:	3/3/3/3
-	Speed	duration	after:	4/5/5/6
-	Bash	%	before:	17%	all	levels
-	bash	%	after:	based	on	movement	speed:	~350	=	17%	~450	=	24%,	~522	=	30%
-	Bonus	movement	before:	15%/15%/15%/15%
-	Bonus	movement	speed	after:	40/60/60/80	(fixed	values,	not	percentage)

Empowering	haste:
-	before:	6%	/	10%	/	14%	/	18%
-	after:	bonus	based	on	proximity	to	enemy	heroes,	the	closer	you	are	the	faster	you	get	6-12%	/	10-20%	/
14-28%	/	18-36%,	but	only	if	you	face	the	enemy	hero,	if	you	turn	your	back	the	bonus	is	minimal
(6/10/14/18).	Also	the	more	enemy	heroes	you	face	the	more	bonus	speed	you	get	(which	means	if	you	face	2
heroes	you	get	the	same	bonus	speed	from	twice	the	distance	compared	to	1	enemy	hero).	The	bonus	has	a
limit	distance	(I	call	it	smell...he	smells	the	enemy	heroes	and	get	angrier	the	closer	he	gets	because	he
smells	their	stench,	the	more	enemies	there	are	the	stronger	is	the	stench	and	the	agrier	he	gets,	and	if	he
turns	away	it	means	he	is	scared,	and	nether	spirits	contrary	to	common	spirits	when	they	are	afraid
actually	are	slow	and	weak	and	their	mind	is	scrambled),	the	limit	should	be	around	2000	units	fixed	on	all
levels(or	maybe	less,	you	do	the	numbers	:P).
-	It	works	with	Charge	of	Darkenss,	there	might	be	scenarios	like	where	SB	charges	from	bottom	lane	to	top
lane,	and	passes	through	midlane,	should	he	get	proximity	bonus	speed	from	heroes	he	is	not	charging?	No,
but	only	because	he	is	charging,	he	is	in	a	mentally	focused	state	and	does	not	care	for	smells	other	than
the	target	he	chose.	
-	Now	considering	there	is	already	bounty	hunter	which	gives	bonus	movement	speed	to	allied	heroes	close
to	enemy	heroes,	I	consider	just	removing	the	aura	property	and	make	it	a	passive	only	for	spirit	breaker.

Charge	of	Darkness:	
-	Direct	results	of	the	above	changes:	a	succesful	charge	should	give	4/5/5/6	seconds	of	bonus	MS	(which	is
higher	than	before)	and	would	allow	for	more	bashes	after	a	charge
-	Cooldown	from	35	seconds	to	55	seconds
-	Cooldown	decreases	by	2/3/4/5	seconds	with	each	succesful	bashed	units,	should	this	count	bashes	that
happen	while	charging?	Probably	not	because	otherwise	he	would	have	charge	always	ready,	also	he	can't
recover	from	a	skill	he	hasn't	even	finished	executing.

Nether	Strike:
-	I	Feel	like	the	range	is	wonky	in	some	ways,	why	would	aghanim	increase	its	range?	I	think	its	range
should	be	half	the	smell	range	(1000	if	2000,	750	if	1500	etc...whatever	you	choose	it	to	be),	because	he	is
split	between	the	two	realms,	his	effectiveness	is	halved	(therefore	half	the	smell	range)
-	Bonus	damage	might	be	reduced	or	removed	entirely	this	is	a	question	of	numbers,	you	choose	here
-	Aghanim	scepter:
before:	Range	+	150,	Radius	+250,	Cooldown	20seconds
after:	
-	No	range	increase
-	the	Bash	as	passive	skill	gets	the	+250	Radius	as	a	whole	(or	150	o	200	again	numbers	here,	you	test	and
see	which	one	is	more	reasonable),	which	is	applied	to	regular	bashes,	ultimate	and	charge	(the	charge
target	since	the	other	ones	are	already	done	in	some	AOE	which	does	not	depend	from	the	bash),
-	Cooldown	from	20	seconds	to	25	seconds	or	30	but	an	increase	like	the	charge	because...with	aghanim	it
should	work	like	charge,	reducing	the	cd	with	each	bashed	unit.	What	does	this	mean?	If	he	ulti	someone
and	bashes	2	units	(heroes	or	creeps	does	not	matter),	he	should	have	the	ulti	cd	reduced	to	15	seconds	(or
20	or	whatever	number	you	choose),	if	he	ulties	5	units	he	might	get	another	ulti	ready	and	keep	going,	or
charge	someone	if	he	is	out	of	position	(the	enemy)	because	tried	to	escape	from	the	bashlord.	
-	As	last	bonus	aghanims	should	increase	base	and	max	movement	speed	(which	means	it	should	be	active
without	greater	bash	bonus,empowering	haste,	and	boots),	it	should	be	based	around	half	the	bonus	given
by	charge,	or	directly	connect	the	two	abilities,	this	means	he	gets	39/64/89/114	when	he	has	aghanim
scepter,	depending	on	the	level	of	charge	of	darkness.

As	you	can	see	the	changes	don't	modify	its	damage,	but	where	pointed	towards	these	2	factors:
-	He	is	the	true	bashlord,	whereas	bashes	like	troll,void,slardar	are	just	"helpers"	to	the	heroes.	Spirit
breakers	instead	masters	the	bashes	making	it	both	the	pillar	and	the	edge	of	its	combat	style.
-	He	is	the	anger	of	the	nether	realms,	(and	I	think	the	voice	of	the	hero	does	a	wonderful	job	on	showing
this)	and	this	anger	makes	him	faster,	he	feeds	his	anger	on	his	enemies,	jumping	on	them	with	the	ferocity
of	a	beast,	and	the	speed	of	a	predator.

# Total	conversions	assay

Guys.	if	I	may	express	my	advice,	coming	from	a	player	of	mods/total	conversions	alike,	make	a	longterm
plan	for	the	mod.

In	my	experience,	the	only	game	I	have	kept	coming	back	to	is	pvkII,	why?	
PVKII	has	a	fantastic	long	term	plan	about	what	they	want	to	do	with	the	game	with	an	awesome	wiki
where	you	can	see	the	next	to	be	implemented	classes	and	other	things.

You	don't	have	to	make	a	time	table,	but	just	having	a	clear	and	focused	vision	big	enough	to	keep	players
looking	forward	to,	it	is	an	awesome	thing,	it	is	what	makes	players	interested,	thinking	"This	game	is
really	fun	now!	Looking	ahead	it	can	only	get	better!	",	it	is	what	makes	players	come	back	and	check
"what's	new",	players	won't	forget!	Its	the	beauty	of	these	t.c.,	seeing	how	them	get	developed,	playing
them,	realizing	bit	by	bit	the	pieces	fitting	together,	that's	what	makes	them	awesome	and	that's	what
builds	following,	having	a	long	term	plan	as	big	as	you	want,	and	walking	toward	it	to	your	own	set	pace.

I	see	a	lot	of	t.c.	that	try	to	"wrap	up"	things	knowing	they	won't	get	developed	much	building	these	so
called	"final	versions"	and	imho	that's	a	bad	approach,	because	that's	trying	to	offer	a	product/game	that
players	can	have	a	"complete"	experience	with,	and	that's	not	the	purpose	of	these	amazing	teams
arranged	together	that	sometimes	go	pro(	:)	),	be	serious	and	realistic,	the	point	of	these	games	is	not	to
offer	a	complete	gaming	experience,	but	having	a	learning	or	enjoyable	experience	both	from	a	dev	and
player	point	of	view.	I	feel	like	this	is	the	point,	setting

# song	1

Hello,	are	you	there?
there	is	something	for	you,
that	I	want	you	to	do.
It's	fine,	It's	all	right!
to	enslave	the	enemies	and	take	all	the	properties!
Yeah!
that's	the	world,
a	bunch	of	common	laws
that	becomes	the	ball.

don't	be	shy,	just	enjoy
there	is	your	cut,
just	grab	it	and	depart
among	friends,	here	we	go!
just	move	fast	till	it	lasts,	and	aim	to	a	new	game!
nice	shot!
what	you	got,
a	nice	booty,
it's	your	duty
to	be	what	you	want	and	take	what	belongs

to...
