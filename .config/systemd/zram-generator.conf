[zram0]
# This section describes the settings for /dev/zram0.
#
# The maximum amount of memory (in MiB). If the machine has more RAM
# than this, zram device will not be created.
#
# "host-memory-limit = none" may be used to disable this limit. This
# is also the default.
# host-memory-limit = 9048

# The size of the zram device, as a function of MemTotal, both in MB.
# For example, if the machine has 1 GiB, and zram-size=ram/4,
# then the zram device will have 256 MiB.
# Fractions in the range 0.1â€“0.5 are recommended.
#
# The default is "min(ram / 2, 4096)".
zram-size = ram / 1.5
