#+TITLE: Ebooks

- Should have a "KUAL" entry in the library
- If it is broken, reinstall the "hotfix" version of the "coplate" pkg (_known to date_)
- use "KUAL" to launch koreader app

* How to share books
Books can be shared (between devices) using one of these methods:
- zsync from koreader, for single books, need to have access to both devices at the same time
- syncthing for directories
- send to device from calibre wireless connection (if calibre actually manages to recognize the connected device..)
- calibre content server (access from client device, browsing is fairly limited)
