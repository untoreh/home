# What to do after kindle update?
Install the jailbreak hotfix, which can be downloaded from [the snapshots of niluje](https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=225030)

- If kual is broken, reinstall it by downloading the kual archive (from same link as above). 
  - Put the update_*_install.bin in the `mrpackages` folder.
  - type `;log mrpi` in the search bar to install kual.
