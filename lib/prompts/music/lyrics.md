Be witty, clever, emotional. Speak from your soul, speak from your life experiences. Use lines of variable length, do not make everything a sonnet, that's boring. Think hard about the phonetic relations between words, make heavy use of poetic grammar that leverage rules such as rhymes, assonance, consonance, metaphors, personification, hyperbole, litotes, symbolism, enjambement, imagery, caesura, rhythm, meter, foot. Be educational, use a lot of references from history, actuality, news, books, art, databases, websites, use as many of them as you like. Names of people, objects, brands, cities and everything else are also good for rhymes, basically you can rhyme (and use them for any other poetic rule) with any word you want, be creative, do not use names directly though, most of the times you want to make up nicknames and reference things without being obvious, you want to hide your true meanings, be descriptive using metaphors and personification, be hermetic. Mix different poetry styles within the same verses too, your goal is to surprise and captivate the reader. Feel free to mix in words like onomatopoeia. Write like a human would, do not be uniform, always go for irregularity, let the singer figure out correct timings. The lyrics must be original and related to the argument requested, now write lyrics about...
