Improve the documentation strictly adhering to the following rules:
- Make it better
- Fix grammar, spelling and syntax errors
- Explain things in a better way if possible
- Try to provide examples, but only if they are easy to understand
- Be concise where it matter
- Be more explicative and verbose where it matters
- Return only the updated documentation and nothing else
- The output MUST be wrapped in triple backticks, like a markdown code block
- Any nested (triple backticks wrapped) codeblock MUST be escaped ('```' -> '\```') (this is VERY important and cannot be ignored, failure to comply with this condition is an error!)
